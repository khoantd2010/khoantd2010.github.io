Abstract:
Network virtualization is ubiquitously an essential attribute to enable the success of the future virtualized networks (e.g. forthcoming 5G network, smart Internet of Things (IoT)). Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is the main challenge in network virtualization that allows multiple heterogeneous Virtual Networks (VNs) to simultaneously coexist on top of a shared substrate infrastructure. Many VNE algorithms have been proposed over past decades but most of them are merely focusing on VNE node mapping and leaving link mapping task for the popular k-shortest path algorithms or multi-commodity flow (MCF) mechanism. In this paper, we propose an intelligent VNE orchestration for link mapping stage which exploits distributed parallelism to considerably reduce the processing time with high efficiency. Extensive simulations have shown that our proposed algorithm outperforms the most popular VNE algorithms.
